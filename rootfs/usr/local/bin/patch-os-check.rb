# Makes the app's operating system check pass, so measurements also run on
# architectures it does not officially support.
#
# At startup the app decides whether the system is supported and keeps the
# answer in its state as validOs; while false, the whole measurement menu
# stays disabled. Every Linux entry in its support table allows "x64" as the
# only architecture:
#
#   h.supported.linux.ubuntu.architectures = ["x64"]
#   ...
#   "ubuntu" === d.toLowerCase() && <release checks>
#     && h.supported.linux.ubuntu.architectures.indexOf(u) > -1
#     && (h.allowed = !0)
#
# and a single reducer copies that verdict into validOs:
#
#   case APP_START:
#     return Object.assign({}, e, {validOs: t.validOs, is32BitOs: ..., ...})
#
# Pinning that one value to true is enough and app.asar holds
# no native code, so there is nothing "x86-only" to emulate.
#
# The replacement is padded with spaces to the exact length of what it
# replaces, keeping every asar offset valid without unpacking and repacking
# the 250 MB archive on the target device.
